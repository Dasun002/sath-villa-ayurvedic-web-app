    <h2>About Ayurveda</h2>
    <p>
      Ayurveda, the ‚ÄúScience of Life,‚Äù is one of the world‚Äôs oldest holistic healing systems, 
      rooted in ancient India over 5000 years ago. More than just a form of medicine, Ayurveda 
      is a way of living that nurtures the deep connection between mind, body, and spirit. 
      Through a unique blend of natural therapies, herbal remedies, mindful practices, and 
      dietary wisdom, Ayurveda empowers you to discover balance, vitality, and inner peace.
    </p>

    <p style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: "1.2rem" }}>

      <strong>Vatha ¬∑ Pitha ¬∑ Kapha</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike quick fixes, Ayurveda is personalized ‚Äî designed around your unique body constitution 
      (doshas) and lifestyle. Its timeless practices promote detoxification, rejuvenation, 
      stress release, and long-term wellness, guiding you back to your true natural rhythm.
